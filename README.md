### Bio

A senior journalist who has worked in mainstream media for 14 years is now working on cloud computing. Along with studying Cloud Engineering, working hard to gift something wonderful to the future 'IT world'. Amazon Web Services (AWS) Solutions Architect.

My story is completely different... I am a professional journalist, with 14 years of experience. I studied Mass Communication and Journalism at university. Journalism was my dream. Therefore, even after passing my Master's in the first class, I had the opportunity to become a university teacher, I took up journalism as a passion without thinking about that attractive job.

But after the coronavirus attacked the world, my goal changed. My dream changed. Increased inclination towards technology. Firstly, I learned Web Development. One by one I learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, NodeJS, Bootstrap, Tailwind CCS, Express.JS, MongoDB, and more. I also did many interesting projects.

Then I came to the world of cloud computing. As I wandered through each branch of the cloud, my interest grew. Completed Amazon Web Services (AWS) Solutions Architect Associate Course. Now I read about Amazon's services, and architects all day long.

Many colorful experiences in my life. I am a good communicator and journalist, and I also have experience as an editor. I edited three magazines (The Golf Bangladesh, The Security, and Kahon). I can write good scripts too! Along with cloud computing, I want to use all these qualities to become the best cloud engineer. This is my passion now. This is my dream.

Now I am very enjoying AWS Cloud Architect. I get very excited when a company migrates to the Amazon Cloud and reduces costs. I feel great joy in making the right solutions.
