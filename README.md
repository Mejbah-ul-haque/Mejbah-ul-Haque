### Bio

-I am very passionate about web development. Created several projects using JavaScript, ReactJS, NodeJS, Express.JS, HTML3, CSS3, Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap. With my programming knowledge I can lead your company to greater success -this is my confidence.

 I am very sincere and dedicated about my task. I am very stubborn and do whatever I want and do it anyways. 

For example, after 12 years of journalism, I think the web development field seems to be perfect for me. So let's start learning. Easy to say, but hard to do. I've had a lot of trouble. But I did not give up. In the end I succeeded.

Besides a full time job and maintaining my family I have to spend 7-8 hours every day. This is where you realize how hard I can work! 

The web development field is very challenging. I like to take challenges.

Now I am very enjoying web development. I am really excited when I am coding. Sometimes itâ€™s challenging but I enjoy it.
